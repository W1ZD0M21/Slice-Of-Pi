'Slice Of Pi' Branded Apparel 


What is Slice Of Pi?

Slice Of Pi apparel is the perfect way to wear your support for our amazing community on your sleeve by rocking one of a number of collectible super-limited blockchain-verified fashion items. 


Why Slice Of Pi?

We all want to stand out from the crowd, to showcase our individuality through our fashion choices, and to know that we have something that no one else does, and Slice Of Pi does all this and more. The vision for Slice Of Pi apparel is an ongoing frequently updated collection of individually blockchain verified apparel items, ensuring that the wearer has something truly unique every time. 


An Investment You Can Wear.

Unlike the collectibe blockchain-verified digital items you may be familiar with, a Slice Of Pi apparel item has all the verifiable uniqueness of an NFT, but brings the real-world practicality of wearable fashion to the table. The truth is that more than likely, outside of a select few enthusiasts, not many people in your social circles give a damn about your NFT collection, but fashion is ubiquitous and universally appreciated. With Slice Of Pi, you invest in something that is tangible, functional, and instantly on display for others to admire. Since every item is verifiably unique and registered on the blockchain, it is an instant conversation piece: every Slice Of Pi item is a fashion statement and display of cryptocurrency investment rolled into one.


By The Community, For The Community.

The Pi community is a hive of massively talented individuals, from designers and artists to manufacturers and coders, and this project aims to build a team of excited, dedicated people focused on creating something that is both profitable as well as positive for the community.Ideally every T-shirt, cap, hoodie, pair of sneakers and any other item will be designed, manufactured, marketed, and sold using the Pi ecosystem in a variety of ways.

The business model of Slice Of Pi is very adaptable to collaborative efforts with other existing fashion and apparel brands. Imagine the known exclusivity of Supreme or the worldwide recognition of Nike or Adidas with the blockchain-verifiable uniqueness of Slice Of Pi. The possibilities and potential are endless.


Eye On The Pi.

Through digital marketing, publicity, and the afore-mentioned possibility of collaborations, the potential for Slice Of Pi to bring widespread attention to the Pi project itself and to the community as a whole is an exciting prospect.


Giving Back.

I genuinely believe that the Pi project in its' entirety is a noble endeavour, and that it is one worth putting effort into. With this in mind, Slice Of Pi will be donating a portion of all profits back into the ecosystem by helping to fund other promising Pi community initiatives and projects.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to receiving your support.
